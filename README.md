###Overview of Project 2 and all tasks
The first steps I took was to create and sign in with a student account on Azure.
I the created a resource group on Azure and created a server and database that will be found in that resource group.
I connected SSMS with my Azure Database and created all the additional tables.
I created my .NET API project on Visual Studios 2022 and created all the new classes and controllers.
Then I connected Visual Studios to my database and ensured everything is running as should.
Published the project API to Azure but had problems importing the URL.
